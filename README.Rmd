# cmep

The `cmep` package can be used to read CMEP formatted files into R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `cmep` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ajholgui/cmep")
```

## Example

Read the sample file:

```{r example}
library(cmep)
f <- system.file("extdata", "cmep.dat", package = "cmep", mustWork = TRUE)
read_cmep(f)
```

## Related Work

There is a CMEP parser (https://github.com/craignicholson/cmepparser) developed
in Go, which formats the data as JSON.
